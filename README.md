# IROS 2023

This repository contains code supporting four work-in-progress presentations by Hendrix College students and faculty at IROS 2023.

For Gabriel Ferrer's presentation **Fuzzy Visual Obstacle Avoidance Using OpenCV and iRobot Create3**, the file [fuzzy_multi_avoider.py](https://github.com/gjf2a/iros2023/blob/main/fuzzy_multi_avoider.py) is the file to run for the robot to execute the fuzzy avoidance behavior. Support code is also found in [fuzzy.py](https://github.com/gjf2a/iros2023/blob/main/fuzzy.py), [morph_contour_demo.py](https://github.com/gjf2a/iros2023/blob/main/morph_contour_demo.py), [ir_bump_turn.py](https://github.com/gjf2a/ros2_create3_examples/blob/main/ir_bump_turn.py), and [runner.py](https://github.com/gjf2a/iros2023/blob/main/runner.py).

All of the code for Isaac Khounborine's presentation **ROS 2.0 in the Classroom** is in the [Khounborine](https://github.com/gjf2a/iros2023/tree/main/Khounborine) subdirectory.

For Joseph Washum's presentation **Design and Implementation of a User-Controlled Obstacle Avoiding Robot Using ROS**, the file [learning_q_xbox.py](https://github.com/gjf2a/iros2023/blob/main/learning_q_xbox.py) is the file to run for the robot to train and run the Q-learner. Support code is also found in [runner.py](https://github.com/gjf2a/iros2023/blob/main/runner.py) and [qlearning.py](https://github.com/gjf2a/iros2023/blob/main/qlearning.py). We also rely on the [evdev](https://pypi.org/project/evdev/) package for interacting with the XBox controller.

The code for Henry Jackon's presentation **Assessing the Internal Odometry Systems in the iRobot Create 3** is forthcoming.

If you have any questions or comments, please post an issue, or feel free to contact [Dr. Ferrer](https://gjf2a.github.io/) directly.
